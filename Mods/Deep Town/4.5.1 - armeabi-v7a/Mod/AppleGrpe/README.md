# Modding:
## Installing the original
Go to [apkcombo](https://apkcombo.com/en-dk/apk-downloader/?device=&arch=armeabi-v7a&android=&q=com.rockbite.deeptown) and download the apk file. --if you are already on apkcombo, select architecture to armeabi-v7a and set package name to com.rockbite.deeptown and download the apk. Because you don't wanna get split apks, use "Split APKs Installer (SAI)" or any other split apks installer. and note that this will mod a single apk file. go to [platinmods](https://platinmods.com/threads/how-to-mod-split-apks-app-bundles.74051/) for that. And if the apk file doesn't use  that architecture, go to that also.-
