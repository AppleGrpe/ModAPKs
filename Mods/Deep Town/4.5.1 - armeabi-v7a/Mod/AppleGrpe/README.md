# Modding:
1. Go to "https://apkcombo.com/en-dk/apk-downloader/?device=&arch=armeabi-v7a&android=&q=com.rockbite.deeptown" and download the apk file. ( if you are already on apkcombo, select architecture to armeabi-v7a and set package name to com.rockbite.deeptown and download the apk.( because you don't wanna get split apks, use "Split APKs Installer (SAI)" or any other split apks installer. and note that this will mod a single apk file. go to "https://platinmods.com/threads/how-to-mod-split-apks-app-bundles.74051/" for that. And if the apk file doesn't use  that architecture, go to that also. ) ) 
2. Decompile the apk.
( or extract the apk using ZArchiver or rename the .apk extension to .zip and extract it by using your favorite app. )
3. Modding:
  - Mod whatever you want.
  - for modding and getting whateer you want edit the file(s) located in assets/json/ and use the appropiate json and xml editor.
4. Compile. ( or compress the folders and files and rename the .zip extension to .apk )
